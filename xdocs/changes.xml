<!--  ========================= End of summary ===================================== -->

<h3>Known bugs</h3>

<p>
The Include Controller has some problems in non-GUI mode. 
In particular, it can cause a NullPointerException if there are two include controllers with the same name.
</p>

<p>Once Only controller behaves OK under a Thread Group or Loop Controller,
but otherwise its behaviour is not consistent (or clearly specified).</p>

<p>
The menu item Options / Choose Language does not change all the displayed text to the new language.
To override the default local language, set the JMeter property "language" before starting JMeter. 
</p>

<h3>Incompatible changes</h3>
<p>
When loading sample results from a file, previous results are no longer cleared.
This allows one to merge multiple files.
If the previous behaviour is required,
use the menu item Run/Clear (Ctrl+Shift+E) or Run/Clear All (Ctrl+E) before loading the file.
</p>
<p>
The test elements "Save Results to a file" and "Generate Summary Results" are now shown as Listeners.
They were previously shown as Post-Processors, even though they are implemented as Listeners.
</p>
<p>
The Cookie Manager no longer saves incoming cookies as variables by default.
To save cookies as variables, define the property "CookieManager.save.cookies=true".
Also, cookies names are prefixed with "COOKIE_" before they are stored (this avoids accidental corruption of local variables)
To revert to the original behaviour, define the property "CookieManager.name.prefix= " (one or more spaces).
</p>
<p>
The Counter element is now shown as a Configuration element.
It was previously shown as a Pre-Processor, even though it is implemented as a Config item.
</p>
<p>
The above changes only affect the icons that are displayed and the locations in the GUI pop-up menus.
They do not affect test plans or test behaviour.
</p>
<p>
The PreProcessors are now invoked directly by the JMeterThread class,
rather than by the TestCompiler#configureSampler() method. (JMeterThread handles the PostProcessors).
This does not affect test plans or behaviour, but could perhaps affect 3rd party add-ons (very unlikely).
</p>
<p>
Moved the Scoping Rules sub-section from Section 3. "Building a Test Plan"  to Section 4. "Elements of a test plan"
</p>

<p>
The While controller now trims leading and trailing spaces from the condition value before it is compared
with LAST, blank or false.
</p>

<p>
The "threadName" variable in the _jexl() and __javaScript() functions was previously misspelt as "theadName".
</p>

<p>
The following deprecated methods were removed from JOrphanUtils: booleanToString(boolean) and valueOf(boolean).
Java 1.4+ has these methods in the Boolean class.
</p>

<p>
The TestElement interface has some new methods:
<ul>
<li>void setProperty(String key, String value, String dflt)</li>
<li>void setProperty(String key, boolean value, boolean dflt)</li>
<li>void setProperty(String key, int value)</li>
<li>void setProperty(String key, int value, int dflt)</li>
<li>int getPropertyAsInt(String key, int defaultValue)</li>
</ul>
These are implemented in the AbstractTestElement class which all elements should extend so this is unlikely to cause a problem.
</p>
