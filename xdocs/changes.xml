<!--  ========================= End of summary ===================================== -->

<h3>Known bugs</h3>

<p>
The Include Controller has some problems in non-GUI mode. 
In particular, it can cause a NullPointerException if there are two include controllers with the same name.
</p>

<p>Once Only controller behaves OK under a Thread Group or Loop Controller,
but otherwise its behaviour is not consistent (or clearly specified).</p>

<p>
The menu item Options / Choose Language does not change all the displayed text to the new language.
To override the default local language, set the JMeter property "language" before starting JMeter. 
</p>

<h3>Incompatible changes</h3>
<p>
The test elements "Save Results to a file" and "Generate Summary Results" are now shown as Listeners.
They were previously shown as Post-Processors, even though they are implemented as Listeners.
</p>
<p>
The Counter element is now shown as a Configuration element.
It was previously shown as a Pre-Processor, even though it is implemented as a Config item.
</p>
<p>
The above changes only affect the icons that are displayed and the locations in the GUI pop-up menus.
They do not affect test plans or test behaviour.
</p>
<p>
The PreProcessors are now invoked directly by the JMeterThread class,
rather than by the TestCompiler#configureSampler() method. (JMeterThread handles the PostProcessors).
This does not affect test plans or behaviour, but could perhaps affect 3rd party add-ons (very unlikely).
</p>
<p>
Moved the Scoping Rules sub-section from Section 3. "Building a Test Plan"  to Section 4. "Elements of a test plan"
</p>
