<h3>Known bugs</h3>

<p>
The Include Controller has some problems in non-GUI mode. 
In particular, it can cause a NullPointerException if there are two include controllers with the same name.
</p>

<p>Once Only controller behaves OK under a Thread Group or Loop Controller,
but otherwise its behaviour is not consistent (or clearly specified).</p>

<p>
The menu item Options / Choose Language does not change all the displayed text to the new language.
To override the default local language, set the JMeter property "language" before starting JMeter. 
</p>

<h3>Incompatible changes</h3>
<ul>
The test element "Save Results to a file" is now shown as a Listener.

It does not affect test plans or test behaviour.
