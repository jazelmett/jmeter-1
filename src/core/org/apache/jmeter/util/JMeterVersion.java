     * The SVN tag can be created as follows:
     * - ensure workspace is up-to-date with SVN
     * - touch this file by running "ant touch-version"
     * - create the tag from workspace: 
     *   "svn cp . https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jakarta/jmeter/tags/TAGNAME"
     * - Checkout the tag
     *
     * The REVISION string is checked by the Ant build file to ensure that the value
     * agrees with the tag revision
