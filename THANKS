This project includes HTMLParser.

For detailed information about HTMLParser, the project is

The developers of JMeter and Apache are grateful to the developers
of HTMLParser for re-releasing htmlparser under CPL V1.0

HTMLParser was originally created by Somik Raha in 2000.
Derrick Oswald is the current lead developer and was kind
enough to assist JMeter.
